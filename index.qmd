# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Open Science Guide for Parkinson's disease research! 

This is an online book written with the following aims:

* help educate on principles of open science
* provide ideas, resources, and examples to facilitate open and reproducible science

This online book was written as a high-level, easily readable, and accessible guide for Parkinson's disease researchers across all levels of expertise, but we hope that it's useful for others as well.
