**A practical guide to advancing open science in Parkinson’s disease research — principles, considerations, tools, and community best practices.**

## 📖 Read the Guide

👉 [**Open Science Guide for Parkinson’s Research**](https://mjff-researchcommunity.github.io/open-science-guide/)

## Why This Guide?

Open science holds enormous potential for accelerating progress in Parkinson’s disease (PD) research. Yet navigating open data, reproducible methods, and sharing practices within disease-focused research can be challenging.

This guide helps researchers:

-   ✅ Understand open science principles relevant to PD research
-   ✅ Consider ethical and practical issues
-   ✅ Adopt tools and platforms that promote transparency and collaboration
-   ✅ Learn from real-world examples and community practices
