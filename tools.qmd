# Tools {#sec-tools}

This chapter aims to provide readers with a comprehensive list of tools (e.g, software, websites, checklists) that facilitate the principles of open science (see @sec-principles). Our aim is to inspire discovery of new tools and awareness of options for researchers to explore when conducting open science projects.

## Data Management & Sharing

* **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)**: A CERN-backed repository that assigns DOIs to datasets, code, and other research outputs. Supports versioning and integration with GitHub.
* **[Figshare](https://figshare.com/)**: Platform for storing, sharing, and discovering research data with built-in metrics and DOI assignment.
* **[Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)**: All-in-one platform for project management, collaboration, and sharing of research materials with version control.
* **[Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/)**: Free and secure cloud-based communal repository where you can store your data, ensuring it is easy to share, access and cite.
* **[PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)**: Repository of freely-available medical research data, managed by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology.
* **[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)**: Collaborative compute space that allows scientists to share and analyze data


## Open Access Publishing

* **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)**: Preprint server primarily for physics, mathematics, and computer science papers.
* **[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)**: Preprint server primarily for papers in biology. 
* **[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/)**: Preprint server for the health sciences
* Open access journals

## Reporting Checklists

** CONSORT/STROBE etc.

## Open-Source Programming Languages

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: general-purpose programming language used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation
* **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**: a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.


## Reproducibility Tools

* **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)**: Web application for creating and sharing documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
* **[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**: integrated development environment (IDE) with tools built to help you be more productive with R and Python.
* **[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)**: Framework for combining results and prose in reproducible documents across multiple programming languages
* **[quarto](https://quarto.org/)**: an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

## Fun fact!

This online book you are reading was developed and hosted with open source tools, including R/RStudio, quarto, git/GitHub, and Zenodo. Pretty cool!

## Open Education Resources

* **OpenStax**: Nonprofit educational initiative providing free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed textbooks.
* **Coursera/edX**: Platforms offering free access to university courses (some certificates may require payment).
* **MIT OpenCourseWare**: Web-based publication of virtually all MIT course content, freely available to anyone.
* **Open Textbook Library**: Collection of free, peer-reviewed, and openly-licensed textbooks.
