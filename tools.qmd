# Tools {#sec-tools}

This chapter aims to provide readers with a comprehensive list of tools (e.g, software, websites, checklists) that facilitate the principles of open science (see @sec-principles). Our aim is to inspire discovery of new tools and awareness of options for researchers to explore when conducting open science projects in Parkinson's disease.

## Data Management & Sharing

* **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)**: A CERN-backed repository that assigns DOIs to datasets, code, and other research outputs. Supports versioning and integration with GitHub.
* **[Figshare](https://figshare.com/)**: Platform for storing, sharing, and discovering research data with built-in metrics and DOI assignment.
* **[Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)**: All-in-one platform for project management, collaboration, and sharing of research materials with version control.
* **[Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/)**: Free and secure cloud-based communal repository where you can store your data, ensuring it is easy to share, access and cite.
* **[PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)**: Repository of freely-available medical research data, managed by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology.
* **[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)**: Collaborative compute space that allows scientists to share and analyze data

## Parkinson's Disease-Specific Data Tools

* **[Getting Started with Parkinson's Disease Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11167237)**: living document that enables researchers to get started with AMP PD, PPMI, GP2, and Fox Insight data sets
* **[Useful PPMI Clinical Codes](https://github.com/MJFF-ResearchCommunity/Useful-PPMI-Clinical-Codes/tree/main)**: facilitates access to clinical data available in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study
* **[Parkinsonâ€™s Insight Engine (PIE)](https://github.com/MJFF-ResearchCommunity/PIE)**: enables efficient data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation for machine learning tasks using multi-modal data (clinical, imaging, biologic, genetic) while ensuring ease of use and reproducibility for PPMI and other MJFF data

## Open Access Publishing

* **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)**: Preprint server primarily for physics, mathematics, and computer science papers.
* **[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)**: Preprint server primarily for papers in biology. 
* **[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/)**: Preprint server for the health sciences
* **[Research Square](https://www.researchsquare.com/)**: multidisciplinary preprint and author services platform
* Open access journals

## Reporting Checklists

* **[Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR)](https://www.equator-network.org/)**: many of these checklists are required for journal submission and can serve as a handy guide when preparing scientific publications (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, etc.)

## Open-Source Programming Languages

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: general-purpose programming language used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation
* **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**: a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics

## Version Control

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual)**: lightweight distributed version control system
* **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**: platform for hosting and collaborating on code built on `git`
* **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)**: all-in-one DevOps platform built on `git`
* **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/)**: code collaboration platform in the Atlassian ecosystem compatible with `git`

## Reproducibility Tools

* **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)**: Web application for creating and sharing documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text
* **[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**: integrated development environment (IDE) with tools built to help you be more productive with R and Python
* **[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)**: Framework for combining results and prose in reproducible documents across multiple programming languages
* **[quarto](https://quarto.org/)**: an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: streamlined code editor
