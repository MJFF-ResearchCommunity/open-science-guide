    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the Open Science Guide for Parkinson’s disease research!\nThis is an online book written with the following aims:\n\nhelp educate on principles of open science\nprovide ideas, resources, and examples to facilitate open and reproducible science\n\nThis online book was written as a high-level, easily readable, and accessible guide for Parkinson’s disease researchers across all levels of expertise, but we hope that it’s useful for others as well.\n\n\nInterested in contributing?\nFeel free to contribute if you find a section with missing, incomplete, or incorrect information. For more substantive edits, such as an entire section or chapter, we recommend submitting an issue for clearance from admins (see below).\nHere are three ways you can contribute:\n\nGo to our GitHub repo and file an issue.\nVisit our GitHub repo, modify a .qmd file directly, and submit a pull request\nClone our GitHub repo, create a branch, modify documents, and submit a pull request\n\n\n\nStep-by-step to contribute on Github\n\nFork the repository:\n\nGo to the GitHub page of the repository you want to contribute to.\n\nClick the “Fork” button (this creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account).\n\nClone your fork:\n\nOpen a terminal and run the following command, replacing your-username/repo-name with your GitHub username and the name of the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git\nChange into the cloned directory:\ncd repo-name\n\nSet up the original repository as a remote (optional but recommended):\n\nThis allows you to keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the original repository.\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git\ngit fetch upstream\n\nCreate a new branch for your changes:\n\nIt’s good practice to make changes on a separate branch instead of main.\ngit checkout -b feature-branch-name\nReplace feature-branch-name with a descriptive name for your changes (e.g., fix-typo-docs).\n\nMake your changes and commit them:\n\nEdit the files as needed.\n\nStage your changes:\ngit add .\nCommit your changes with a descriptive message:\ngit commit -m \"Brief description of your changes\"\n\nKeep your branch up to date (to prevent conflicts):\n\nBefore pushing your changes, update your branch with the latest changes from the original repository:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/main\nIf there are conflicts, resolve them before continuing.\n\nPush your changes to your fork:\n\nOnce your branch is up to date, push it to your GitHub fork:\ngit push origin feature-branch-name\n\nCreate a Pull Request (PR):\n\nGo to your forked repository on GitHub.\n\nClick the “Compare & pull request” button.\n\nProvide a clear description of your changes and submit the PR.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nIf you are asked to make changes, update your branch, commit the changes, and push again.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with resolving merge conflicts, GitHub provides a web interface to help you.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project is supported by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.",

    "text": "2.6 Making Projects Citeable\nWe recommend establishing or creating a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to enable researchers and the public to easily cite and access your work. A DOI is a permanent, unique identifier assigned to digital objects such as research papers, datasets, software, and code repositories. It provides a stable and citable link to the content, even if the location (URL) changes.\nFor example, a DOI link will look like this: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14984668 with 10.5281/zenodo.14984668 representing the DOI. It will always resolve to the same location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that 10.5281/zenodo.14984668 is in fact the DOI for this online book! Fun fact, with new pushes to the GitHub repository that hosts this book, Zenodo will automatically keep track of updates, while the DOI will always resolve to the latest version.\n\n\nHere are some recommended places to create a DOI depending on where your Open Science project lives:\n\nFor a GitHub repository → Zenodo (automatic DOI for software releases).\nFor datasets → Figshare, Dryad, or Zenodo.\nFor a general research project → OSF.\n\n\n\n\n\nDennis, Simon, Paul Garrett, Hyungwook Yim, Jihun Hamm, Adam F.
