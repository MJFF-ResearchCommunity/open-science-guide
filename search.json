Below is a brief non-exhaustive list of potential benefits:\n\nIncreased effectiveness of the scientific method\n\nOpen science practices advance innovation and accelerate discoveries by allowing scientists to build on (and replicate) existing work more efficiently and effectively. Open Science fosters global collaboration by enabling researchers from different institutions, disciplines, and countries to work together.\n\nIncreased trust in scientific work\n\nOpen science practices help to reduce errors, building trust and confidence in findings across the research and public domains.\n\nIncreased benefit to the public and common good\n\nOpen Science aligns with ethical principles by promoting fairness, accountability, and knowledge sharing, ensuring that research contributes to the common good.",
