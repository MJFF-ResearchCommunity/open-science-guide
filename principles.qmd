# Principles

Let us begin with addressing two fundamental questions:

* What is Open Science?
* What are the principles of Open Science?

This is a large and ongoing area of investigation that we cannot cover in this brief chapter, so we recommend readers to view the cited publications to learn more.

## Definition

**“Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks”** [@vicente-saezOpenScienceNow2018].

The main focus of this guide is to describe tools and resources that address the aspects of **transparency** and **accessibility** of knowledge/evidence gathered from scientific studies of Parkinson's disease.

Some investigators describe Open Science as a layered, gradient approach with increasing levels of transparency and accessibility (ADD THE CITATION HERE):

FAIR Data Principles: Making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

## Importance

Why does transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility matter?

## Ethical & Regulatory Considerations

How to share data while respecting patient privacy (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Open Peer Review & Collaboration

Encouraging constructive criticism and transparency in research assessment.
